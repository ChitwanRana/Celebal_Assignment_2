This is a simple and interactive web application built with **Django** that allows users to manage a **Singly Linked List** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Users can add nodes, display the current state of the list, and delete a node at a specified index.

📦 Each node is visually represented using styled Bootstrap cards, along with subscript indices and directional arrows for enhanced clarity.
